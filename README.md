# **Skynet portal migration guide - Updated: October 3, 2023**

It's been some time since the shutdown of Skynet Labs and this guide no longer serves a purpose so it was updated to reflect this reality.


## **What's next?**

Idea of Skynet prevails in the form of two projects heavily inspired by it.

[S5 by redsolver](https://github.com/s5-dev/S5) - content addressed storage network (similar to IPFS and using many of its formats and standards) that utilizes multiple storage solutions, including Sia, to allow creation of apps like [Vup](https://vup.app) from the same author
[Lume by pcfreak30](https://docs.lumeweb.com/) - P2P network (similar to BitTorrent), storage portal, and end-user gateway, but ready to service the Web3, intending to bridge the gap between various technologies and using Sia as its storage layer
